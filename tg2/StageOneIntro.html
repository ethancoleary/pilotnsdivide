    <h3>The game</h3>
    <br>
    Person A first receives 2 tokens, each worth Â£2.00, while person B receives nothing.
    Person A may send some, none, or all of their tokens to person B.
    Any tokens they do not send is theirs to keep. For every token person A sends, person B will receive 3 tokens.
    For example, if person A sends 1 token, person B will receive 3 tokens.
    Person B then decides how many of the tokens received they wish to return to person A.
<br>
<br>
    Person A's earnings from this round are the tokens they do not send plus the tokens returned to them.
    Person B's earnings equal the amount they receive minus the amount they return.

    Your partner may decide to send 0, 1 or 2 tokens. You need to decide what you would like to do in each of these instances.
    After you have made your choices, your partner will make theirs and your payoffs will be computed accordingly.

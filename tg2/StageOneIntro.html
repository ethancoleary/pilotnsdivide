    <h3>The game</h3>
    <br>
   Person A starts with 3 tokens, and Person B starts with none. Person A can send some, all, or none of their tokens to Person B. Any tokens kept by Person A are theirs. For every token sent, Person B receives 3 tokens.
<br><br>
For example, if Person A sends 2 tokens, Person B will get 6 tokens.
<br><br>
Person B then decides how many tokens to return to Person A.
<br><br>
Person A's earnings are the tokens they kept plus any returned to them. Person B's earnings are what they received minus what they returned.

    Your partner can send you either 0, 1, 2 or 3 tokens. You need to decide how many tokens you would like to return in each of these instances.
    After you have made your choices, your partner will make theirs and your payoffs will be computed accordingly.

    I will refer to you as person B and your partner as person A.
    Both you and your partner receive the same information below about the game.

<br>
<br>

    Person A first receives 5 tokens while person B receives nothing.
    Person A may send some, none, or all of this amount to person B.
    Any amount they do not send is theirs to keep. Any amount they do send to person B is tripled.
    For example, if person A sends 2 tokens then person B will receive 6 tokens.
    Person B then decide how many of the tokens received they wish to return to person A.

<br>
<br>
    Person A's earnings from this round are the tokens they do not send plus the tokens returned to them.
    Person B's earnings equal the amount received minus the amount they return.

<br>
<br>
    The game is shown in the below diagram.

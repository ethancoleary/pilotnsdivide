    I will refer to you as person B and your partner as person A.
    Both you and your partner receive the same information below about the game.

<br>
<br>

    Person A first receives 5 tokens while person B receives nothing.
    Person A may send some, none, or all of this amount to person B.
    Any amount they do not send is theirs to keep. Any amount they do send to person B is tripled.
    For example, if person A sends 2 tokens then person B will receive 6 tokens.
    After person A makes a decision, the game is over.

<br>
<br>
    Person A's earnings from this round are the tokens they do not send.
    Person B's earnings equal the tokens they receive.

<br>
<br>
    The game is shown in the below diagram.

    However, before doing so, we need to check your comprehension of the game. Click next to proceed.

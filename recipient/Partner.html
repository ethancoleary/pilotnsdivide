Your partner will decide how many tokens they wish to send you.
This amount will be tripled and that will be your payment for this round.

<br><br>

Since you do not make a decision here, we ask you to guess how many tokens your partner will send to you.
You will earn an extra 2 tokens if your guess is correct.
